	abstract = {Recent work on the fundamental processes of regulation in biology (Ashby, 1956) has shown the importance of a certain quantitative relation called the law of requisite variety. After this relation had been found, we appreciated that it was related to a theorem in a world far removed from the biological---that of Shannon on the quantity of noise or error that could be removed through a correction-channel (Shannon and Weaver, 1949; theorem 10). In this paper I propose to show the relationship between the two theorems, and to indicate something of their implications for regulation, in the cybernetic sense, when the system to be regulated is extremely complex.},

By bringing these areas together we explain the basic ingredients of Dynamic Quantum Logic, a new direction of research in the logical foundations of physics.},

	abstract = {A brief analysis of analog computation is presented, taking into account both historical and more modern statements. I show that two very different concepts are tangled together in some of the literature---namely continuous valued computation and analogy machines. I argue that a more general concept, that of model-based computation, can help us untangle this misconception. A two-dimensional view of computation is offered, in which this model-based dimension is orthogonal to the dimension concerning the type of variables used in components. I argue that this is a useful framework for assessing alternative computing devices and computational claims in an expanding landscape of computation.},

@phdthesis{Beebe2021,
	abstract = {Knowledge transfer in cognitive systems can be explicated in terms of structure mapping and control.  The structure of an effective model enables adaptive control for the system's intended domain of application.  Knowledge is transferred by a system when control of a new domain is enabled by mapping the structure of a previously effective model.  I advocate for a model-based view of computation which recognizes effective structure mapping at a low level.  Artificial neural network systems are furthermore viewed as model-based, where effective models are learned through feedback.  Thus, many of the most popular artificial neural network systems are best understood in light of the cybernetic tradition as error-controlled regulators.  Knowledge transfer with pre-trained networks (transfer learning) can, when automated like other machine learning methods, be seen as an advancement towards artificial general intelligence.  I argue this is convincing because it is akin to automating a general systems methodology of knowledge transfer in scientific reasoning.  Analogical reasoning is typical in such a methodology, and some accounts view analogical cognition as the core of cognition which provides adaptive benefits through efficient knowledge transfer.  I then discuss one modern example of analogical reasoning in physics, and how an extended Bayesian view might model confirmation given a structural mapping between two systems. In light of my account of knowledge transfer, I finally assess the case of quantum-like models in cognition, and whether the transfer of quantum principles is appropriate. I conclude by throwing my support behind a general systems philosophy of science framework which emphasizes the importance of structure, and which rejects a controversial view of scientific explanation in favor of a view of explanation as enabling control.},

	abstract = {The authors study the wavefronts (i.e. the surfaces of constant phase) of the wave discussed by Aharonov and Bohm, representing a beam of particles with charge q scattered by an impenetrable cylinder of radius R containing magnetic flux Phi . Defining the quantum flux parameter by alpha =q Phi /h, they show that for the case R=0 the wave psi AB possesses a wavefront dislocation on the flux line, whose strength (i.e. the number of wave crests ending on the dislocation) equals the nearest integer to alpha . When alpha passes through half-integer values, the strength changes, by wavefronts unlinking and reconnecting along a nodal surface. In quantum mechanics this phase structure is unobservable, but they devise an analogue where surface waves on water encounter an irrotational 'bathtub' vortex; in this case alpha depends on the frequency of the waves and the circulation of the vortex. Experiments show dislocation structures agreeing with those predicted. psi AB is an unusual function in which incident and scattered waves cannot be clearly separated in all asymptotic directions; they discuss its properties using a new asymptotic method.},

@article{Bush2015,
	abstract = { Yves Couder, Emmanuel Fort, and coworkers recently discovered that a millimetric droplet sustained on the surface of a vibrating fluid bath may self-propel through a resonant interaction with its own wave field. This article reviews experimental evidence indicating that the walking droplets exhibit certain features previously thought to be exclusive to the microscopic, quantum realm. It then reviews theoretical descriptions of this hydrodynamic pilot-wave system that yield insight into the origins of its quantum-like behavior. Quantization arises from the dynamic constraint imposed on the droplet by its pilot-wave field, and multimodal statistics appear to be a feature of chaotic pilot-wave dynamics. I attempt to assess the potential and limitations of this hydrodynamic system as a quantum analog. This fluid system is compared to quantum pilot-wave theories, shown to be markedly different from Bohmian mechanics and more closely related to de Broglie's original conception of quantum dynamics, his double-solution theory, and its relatively recent extensions through researchers in stochastic electrodynamics. },

Fundamental to the technology is the idea of on and off, of true and false. So fundamental is this concept of discrete (or digital) state, that it is difficult to imagine how computers could be non-digital, or even if non-digital computers would be computers. This book addresses the history of a different kind of computer technology: one commonly known as `analogue computing'. Once a common alternative to the now-dominant digital computer, analogue technology was used for a whole variety of calculating and modelling applications.},

Using an experimental design of Tversky and Kahneman (1983), it finds that given mild incentives, the proportion of individuals who violate the conjunction principle is significantly lower than that reported by Kahneman and Tversky. Moreover, when subjects are allowed to consult with other subjects, these proportions fall dramatically, particularly when the size of the group rises from two to three. These findings cast serious doubts about the importance and robustness of such violations for the understanding of real-life economic decisions. },

@book{Cordeschi2002,
	abstract = {We have mentioned the paradox of backward causation, which afflicted the explanation of purposeful behavior. This kind of behavior seemed to consist in an inversion of the causal sequence: the future or final result of an action (the end to which it is directed) precedes or anticipates the action. ``A sequence entirely inadmissible in a world of pure mechanism,'' was how McDougall (1923a: 194) saw it. What was known as the metaphysical solution of the paradox always saw the end or the goal of an action as its `fmal cause,' and teleological explanation was considered completely different from causal explanation.1 Thus an unbridgeable gulf opened up between teleology and science, one that challenged the very plausibility of using teleological language in the scientific study of the behavior of living organisms.},

@article{DialecticalGANS2018,
	abstract = {With more and more SAR applications, the demand for enhanced high-quality SAR images has increased considerably. However, high-quality SAR images entail high costs, due to the limitations of current SAR devices and their image processing resources. To improve the quality of SAR images and to reduce the costs of their generation, we propose a Dialectical Generative Adversarial Network (Dialectical GAN) to generate high-quality SAR images. This method is based on the analysis of hierarchical SAR information and the ``dialectical'' structure of GAN frameworks. As a demonstration, a typical example will be shown, where a low-resolution SAR image (e.g., a Sentinel-1 image) with large ground coverage is translated into a high-resolution SAR image (e.g., a TerraSAR-X image). A new algorithm is proposed based on a network framework by combining conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network---Gradient Penalty) loss functions and Spatial Gram matrices under the rule of dialectics. Experimental results show that the SAR image translation works very well when we compare the results of our proposed method with the selected traditional methods.},

While physicists attempt to find ways to create quantum computers, we still do not have much evidence one way or the other as to how useful these machines will be. The tools of computational complexity theory should come to bear on these important questions. Quantum computing often scares away many potential researchers in computer science because of the apparent background need in quantum mechanics and the alien looking notation used in papers on the topic. This paper will give an overview of quantum computation from the point of view of a complexity theorist. We will see that one can think of BQP as yet another complexity class and study its power without focusing on the physical aspects behind it.},

@article{FunSearch2024,
	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous capabilities in solving complex tasks, from quantitative reasoning to understanding natural language. However, LLMs sometimes suffer from confabulations (or hallucinations), which can result in them making plausible but incorrect statements1,2. This hinders the use of current large models in scientific discovery. Here we introduce FunSearch (short for searching in the function space), an evolutionary procedure based on pairing a pretrained LLM with a systematic evaluator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to surpass the best-known results in important problems, pushing the boundary of existing LLM-based approaches3. Applying FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics---the cap set problem---we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best-known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This shows that it is possible to make discoveries for established open problems using LLMs. We showcase the generality of FunSearch by applying it to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, finding new heuristics that improve on widely used baselines. In contrast to most computer search approaches, FunSearch searches for programs that describe how to solve a problem, rather than what the solution is. Beyond being an effective and scalable strategy, discovered programs tend to be more interpretable than raw solutions, enabling feedback loops between domain experts and FunSearch, and the deployment of such programs in real-world applications.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the applications of game theory in deep learning. Today, deep learning is a fast-evolving area for research in the domain of artificial intelligence. Alternatively, game theory has been showing its multi-dimensional applications in the last few decades. The application of game theory to deep learning includes another dimension in research. Game theory helps to model or solve various deep learning-based problems. Existing research contributions demonstrate that game theory is a potential approach to improve results in deep learning models. The design of deep learning models often involves a game-theoretic approach. Most of the classification problems which popularly employ a deep learning approach can be seen as a Stackelberg game. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep learning architecture that has gained popularity in solving complex computer vision problems. GANs have their roots in game theory. The training of the generators and discriminators in GANs is essentially a two-player zero-sum game that allows the model to learn complex functions. This paper will give researchers an extensive account of significant contributions which have taken place in deep learning using game-theoretic concepts thus, giving a clear insight, challenges, and future directions. The current study also details various real-time applications of existing literature, valuable datasets in the field, and the popularity of this research area in recent years of publications and citations.},

	The correctness and optimality of our algorithm is implied by the

Leaving aside the terms ``law'' and ``theory,'' I distinguish principles, specific conditions, models, hypotheses, and generalizations. I argue that scientists use designated similarities between models and aspects of the world to form both hypotheses and generalizations.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Neuroscience is held back by the fact that it is hard to evaluate if a conclusion is correct; the complexity of the systems under study and their experimental inaccessability make the assessment of algorithmic and data analytic technqiues challenging at best. We thus argue for testing approaches using known artifacts, where the correct interpretation is known. Here we present a microprocessor platform as one such test case. We find that many approaches in neuroscience, when used na{\"\i}vely, fall short of producing a meaningful understanding.},

The latter class of inhibition nets is shown to correspond to the class of finite, normal, hierarchical logic programs concerning dynamics, and also to the class of binary, layered, input-driven artificial neural networks. },

@article{Mundy1986,
	abstract = {The numerical representations of measurement, geometry and kinematics are here subsumed under a general theory of representation. The standard theories of meaningfulness of representational propositions in these three areas are shown to be special cases of two theories of meaningfulness for arbitrary representational propositions: the theories based on unstructured and on structured representation respectively. The foundations of the standard theories of meaningfulness are critically analyzed and two basic assumptions are isolated which do not seem to have received adequate justification: the assumption that a proposition invariant under the appropriate group is therefore meaningful, and the assumption that representations should be unique up to a transformation of the appropriate group. A general theory of representational meaningfulness is offered, based on a semantic and syntactic analysis of representational propositions. Two neglected features of representational propositions are formalized and made use of: (a) that such propositions are induced by more general propositions defined for other structures than the one being represented, and (b) that the true purpose of representation is the application of the theory of the representing system to the represented system. On the basis of these developments, justifications are offered for the two problematic assumptions made by the existing theories.},

Is computation the same as information processing? The two terms are often used interchangeably, but this usage masks important differences. In this paper, we distinguish information processing from computation and examine some of their mutual relations, shedding light on the role each can play in a theory of cognition. We recommend that theorists of cognition be explicit and careful in choosing notions of computation and information and connecting them together.},

	abstract = {We begin by distinguishing computationalism from a number of other theses that are sometimes conflated with it. We also distinguish between several important kinds of computation: computation in a generic sense, digital computation, and analog computation. Then, we defend a weak version of computationalism---neural processes are computations in the generic sense. After that, we reject on empirical grounds the common assimilation of neural computation to either analog or digital computation, concluding that neural computation is sui generis. Analog computation requires continuous signals; digital computation requires strings of digits. But current neuroscientific evidence indicates that typical neural signals, such as spike trains, are graded like continuous signals but are constituted by discrete functional elements (spikes); thus, typical neural signals are neither continuous signals nor strings of digits. It follows that neural computation is sui generis. Finally, we highlight three important consequences of a proper understanding of neural computation for the theory of cognition. First, understanding neural computation requires a specially designed mathematical theory (or theories) rather than the mathematical theories of analog or digital computation. Second, several popular views about neural computation turn out to be incorrect. Third, computational theories of cognition that rely on non-neural notions of computation ought to be replaced or reinterpreted in terms of neural computation.},

@article{Pribram1999,
	abstract = {Evidence is presented which indicates that, at the level of conscious experience, information processing in the brain is basically Gabor-like rather than binary (as in Shannon's information measurement theory). The process takes place in a phase space created by a multiply interconnected web of teledendrons, synapses and dendrites. The axons of neurons sample the phase space to create cell assemblies. Assemblies are kaleidoscopic in that the same neuron can partake in a variety of patterns of neuron ensembles. This is much like the variety of patterns created by the features red sweaters, blond hair, or eyeglass wearing in a classroom. A particular student (or neuron) may participate in one or more (or none) of the patterns. The flexibility of conscious experience is attributed to sensory and cognitive challenges that drive the formation of processes in the teledendron-synapse dendritic web. When the formation of axonal patterns takes time (a temporal hold) because of the novelty of the input, they become experienced consciously. },

	abstract = { Forging new memories for facts and events, holding critical details in mind on a moment-to-moment basis, and retrieving knowledge in the service of current goals all depend on a complex interplay between neural ensembles throughout the brain. Over the past decade, researchers have increasingly utilized powerful analytical tools (e.g., multivoxel pattern analysis) to decode the information represented within distributed functional magnetic resonance imaging activity patterns. In this review, we discuss how these methods can sensitively index neural representations of perceptual and semantic content and how leverage on the engagement of distributed representations provides unique insights into distinct aspects of memory-guided behavior. We emphasize that, in addition to characterizing the contents of memories, analyses of distributed patterns shed light on the processes that influence how information is encoded, maintained, or retrieved, and thus inform memory theory. We conclude by highlighting open questions about memory that can be addressed through distributed pattern analyses. },

The intuitionistic fragment of orthologic is found to be translatable into this calculus by means of a quantum version of the Heyting paradigm. When realized in the category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, the familiar qubit arises spontaneously as the irreducible storage capable quantum computational unit, and the necessary involvement of quantum entanglement in the ``quantum duplication'' process is plainly and explicitly visible. Quantum ``computation'' is modelled by a single extra axiom, and reproduces the standard notion when interpreted in a larger category.},

@article{Sharkeyetal1993,
	abstract = {Adaptive generalisation is the ability to use prior knowledge in the performance of novel tasks. Thus, if we are to model intelligent behaviour with neural nets, they must be able to generalise across task domains. Our objective is to elucidate the aetiology of transfer of information between connectionist nets. First, a method is described that provides a standardised score for the quantification of how much task structure a net has extracted, and to what degree knowledge has been transferred between tasks. This method is then applied in three simulation studies to examine Input-to-Hidden (IH) and Hidden-to-Output (HO) decision hyperplanes as determinants of transfer effects. In the first study, positive transfer is demonstrated between functions that require the vertices of their spaces to be divided similarly, and negative transfer between functions that require decision regions of different shapes. In the other two studies, input and output similarity are varied independently in a series of paired associate learning tasks. Further explanation of transfer effects is provided through the use of a new technique that permits better visualisation of the entire computational space by showing both the relative position of inputs in Hidden Unit space, and the HO decision regions implemented by the set of weights.},

	abstract = {Recent attempts to reconcile the ontic and epistemic approaches to explanation propose that our best explanations simply fulfill epistemic and ontic norms simultaneously. I aim to upset this armistice. Epistemic norms of attaining general and systematic explanations are, I argue, autonomous of ontic norms: they cannot be fulfilled simultaneously or in simple conjunction with ontic norms, and plausibly have priority over them. One result is that central arguments put forth by ontic theorists against epistemic theorists are revealed as not only question-begging, but ultimately self-defeating. Another result is that a more nuanced reconciliation of the epistemic and ontic views is required: we should regard good explanatory practice as a dynamic process with distinct phases of epistemic and ontic success.},

	abstract = {It is often claimed that there can be no such thing as a logic of scientific discovery, but only a logic of verification. By 'logic of discovery' is usually meant a normative theory of discovery processes. The claim that such a normative theory is impossible is shown to be incorrect; and two examples are provided of domains where formal processes of varying efficacy for discovering lawfulness can be constructed and compared. The analysis shows how one can treat operationally and formally phenomena that have usually been dismissed with fuzzy labels like 'intuition' and 'creativity'.},

@article{Smetsetal2006,
	abstract = { ABSTRACT The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a dynamic logic formalism for reasoning about information flow in composite quantum systems. This builds on our previous work on a complete quantum dynamic logic for single systems. Here we extend that work to a sound (but not necessarily complete) logic for composite systems, which brings together ideas from the quantum logic tradition with concepts from (dynamic) modal logic and from quantum computation. This Logic of Quantum Programs (LQP) is capable of expressing important features of quantum measurements and unitary evolutions of multi-partite states, as well as giving logical characterisations to various forms of entanglement (for example, the Bell states, the GHZ states etc.). We present a finitary syntax, a relational semantics and a sound proof system for this logic. As applications, we use our system to give formal correctness proofs for the Teleportation protocol and for a standard Quantum Secret Sharing protocol; a whole range of other quantum circuits and programs, including other well-known protocols (for example, superdense coding, entanglement swapping, logic-gate teleportation etc.), can be similarly verified using our logic. },

	of both is that causal graphs are Bayesian nets. The similarity extends
	to the treatment of actions or interventions in the two theories.
	But there is also a crucial difference. Glymour et al. take causal
	dependencies as primitive and argue them to behave like Bayesian
	nets under wide circumstances. By contrast, I argue the behavior
	of Bayesian nets to be ultimately the defining characteristic of

	abstract = {It is argued that a number of important, and seemingly disparate, types of representation are species of a single relation, here called structural representation, that can be described in detail and studied in a way that is of considerable philosophical interest. A structural representation depends on the existence of a common structure between a representation and that which it represents, and it is important because it allows us to reason directly about the representation in order to draw conclusions about the phenomenon that it depicts. The present goal is to give a general and precise account of structural representation, then to use that account to illuminate several problems of current philosophical interest --- including some that do not initially seem to involve representation at all. In particular, it is argued that ontological reductions (like that of the natural numbers to sets), compositional accounts of semantics, several important sorts of mental representation, and (perhaps) possible worlds semantics for intensional logics are all species of structural representation and are fruitfully studied in the framework developed here.},

This paper contends that artificial intelligence is even more than a source of useful analogies for the philosophy of discovery: the two fields are linked by interfield connections between philosophy of science and cognitive psychology and between cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. Because the philosophy of discovery must pay attention to the psychology of practicing scientists, and because current cognitive psychology adopts a computational view of mind with AI providing the richest models of how the mind works, the philosophy of discovery must also concern itself with AI models of mental operations. The relevance of the artificial intelligence notion of a frame to the philosophy of discovery is briefly discussed.},

@article{Trenholme1994,
	abstract = {The distinction between analog and digital representation is reexamined; it emerges that a more fundamental distinction is that between symbolic and analog simulation. Analog simulation is analyzed in terms of a (near) isomorphism of causal structures between a simulating and a simulated process. It is then argued that a core concept, naturalistic analog simulation, may play a role in a bottom-up theory of adaptive behavior which provides an alternative to representational analyses. The appendix discusses some formal conditions for naturalistic analog simulation.},

@article{Vervoort2016,
	abstract = {Recent experiments have shown that certain fluid-mechanical systems, namely oil droplets bouncing on oil films, can mimic a wide range of quantum phenomena, including double-slit interference, quantization of angular momentum and Zeeman splitting. Here I investigate what can be learned from these systems concerning no-go theorems as those of Bell and Kochen-Specker. In particular, a model for the Bell experiment is proposed that includes variables describing a `background' field or medium. This field mimics the surface wave that accompanies the droplets in the fluid-mechanical experiments. It appears that quite generally such a model can violate the Bell inequality and reproduce the quantum statistics, even if it is based on local dynamics only. The reason is that measurement independence is not valid in such models. This opens the door for local `background-based' theories, describing the interaction of particles and analyzers with a background field, to complete quantum mechanics. Experiments to test these ideas are also proposed.},

I raise a puzzle for this ambiguity claim, and then give a deflationary solution under which all ontically-rendered talk of explanation is merely elliptical; what it is elliptical for is a view of scientific explanation that altogether avoids the ontic conception. This result has revisionary consequences for New Mechanists and other philosophers of science, many of whom have assimilated their conception of explanation to the ontic conception.},

	abstract = {We show that the notion of generalized Berry phase i.e., non-abelian holonomy, can be used for enabling quantum computation. The computational space is realized by a n-fold degenerate eigenspace of a family of Hamiltonians parametrized by a manifold M. The point of M represents classical configuration of control fields and, for multi-partite systems, couplings between subsystem. Adiabatic loops in the control M induce non trivial unitary transformations on the computational space. For a generic system it is shown that this mechanism allows for universal quantum computation by composing a generic pair of loops in M. },
